Description
===========
This is a library to enable urllib2 to be used with SSL sockets from pyOpenSSL instead of the built in ssl library. A script is provided to :

thredds_test_file_access::
 - Determines whether access is available to a set of resources specified by URL listed in a file.
   This is intended to be used to check that files that exist in the THREDDS content directories,
   but which are not listed in catalogs, are not accessible.

Prerequisites
=============
This has been developed and tested for Python 2.6 (compiled with HTTPS support).
pyOpenSSL
